## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated Teal Blue (#46878c) to create a professional, calm and trustworthy impression. It aligns well with finance due to its subtle relation to the traditional association of green with money, and blue with dependability.
- Background color: Very light teal/gray (#e0f3f3).  A calm background allows content to take center stage, but it will remain tonally related to the primary.
- Accent color: Sunset Orange (#c97339), adds warmth, energy, and contrast to calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif typeface with an intellectual feel; it supports longer reading, but its clean lines will provide a modern update to Bookerly.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif typeface that's similar to the feel of Bookerly; designed for longer blocks of text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Utilize Lucide React icons throughout the site for clear and aesthetically pleasing visual representation of key functions and information.
- Employ a minimalist design with a focus on whitespace to create a clean and sophisticated user experience.
- Incorporate subtle glass-like (frosted glass) transparency effects on menus and interactive elements to add depth and modernity, mimicking Apple's design trends.
